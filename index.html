        <h2>Jane's Novels</h2>
        <p> Jane wrote a few complete novels, some unfinished ones, letters and sketches.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt class="novels novels__title">Emma</dt>
            <dd>Of all Austen’s novels, Emma is the most consistently comic in tone. It centres on Emma Woodhouse, a
                wealthy,
                pretty,
                self-satisfied young woman who indulges herself with meddlesome and unsuccessful attempts at
                matchmaking
                among
                her friends
                and neighbours. After a series of humiliating errors, a chastened Emma finds her destiny in marriage to
                the
                mature and
                protective George Knightley, a neighbouring squire who had been her mentor and friend.</dd>

            <dd>novel by Jane Austen, published anonymously in three volumes in 1811. The 1995 film adaptation—starring
                Emma
                Thompson,
                Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant—was a critical and commercial success and earned seven Academy Award
                nominations
                (winning one for Emma Thompson for best screenplay). The hit film spurred a resurgence of interest in
                the
                novels
                of Jane Austen and in period films in general, and it helped to establish the reputation of Taiwanese
                director
                Ang Lee.</dd>

    <h2>Jane's Life</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Family</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Jane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother "certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago". </p>
            <p>He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as "a future companion to her sister".</p>
            <p>The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.</p>
