    <h2>Jane's Novels</h2>
    <p> Jane wrote a few complete novels, some unfinished ones, letters and sketches.</p>

    <h3>Emma</h3>
    <p>Of all Austen’s novels, Emma is the most consistently comic in tone. It centres on Emma Woodhouse, a wealthy,
        pretty,
        self-satisfied young woman who indulges herself with meddlesome and unsuccessful attempts at matchmaking among
        her friends
        and neighbours. After a series of humiliating errors, a chastened Emma finds her destiny in marriage to the
        mature and
        protective George Knightley, a neighbouring squire who had been her mentor and friend.</p>
    <h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Mansfield Park</h3>
    <h3>Northanger Abbey</h3>
    <h3>Sense and Sensibility</h3>
    <p>novel by Jane Austen, published anonymously in three volumes in 1811. The 1995 film adaptation—starring Emma
        Thompson,
        Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant—was a critical and commercial success and earned seven Academy Award nominations
        (winning one for Emma Thompson for best screenplay). The hit film spurred a resurgence of interest in the
        novels
        of Jane Austen and in period films in general, and it helped to establish the reputation of Taiwanese director
        Ang Lee.</p>
