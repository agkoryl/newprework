    <h2>Jane's Novels</h2>
    <p> Jane wrote a few complete novels, some unfinished ones, letters and sketches.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt class="novels__title">Emma</dt>
        <dd>Of all Austen’s novels, Emma is the most consistently comic in tone. It centres on Emma Woodhouse, a
            wealthy,
            pretty,
            self-satisfied young woman who indulges herself with meddlesome and unsuccessful attempts at matchmaking
            among
            her friends
            and neighbours. After a series of humiliating errors, a chastened Emma finds her destiny in marriage to the
            mature and
            protective George Knightley, a neighbouring squire who had been her mentor and friend.</dd>

        <dt class="novels__title">Sense and Sensibility</dt>
        <dd>novel by Jane Austen, published anonymously in three volumes in 1811. The 1995 film adaptation—starring
            Emma
            Thompson,
            Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant—was a critical and commercial success and earned seven Academy Award
            nominations
            (winning one for Emma Thompson for best screenplay). The hit film spurred a resurgence of interest in the
            novels
            of Jane Austen and in period films in general, and it helped to establish the reputation of Taiwanese
            director
            Ang Lee.</dd>

    <h2>Jane's Life</h2>
    <p>Jane Austen was born in the Hampshire village of Steventon, where her father, the Reverend George Austen, <br>
        was rector. She was the second daughter and seventh child in a family of eight—six boys and two girls. <br>
        Her closest companion throughout her life was her elder sister, Cassandra; neither Jane nor Cassandra married.
        <br>
        Their father was a scholar who encouraged the love of learning in his children. His wife, <br>
        Cassandra (née Leigh), was a woman of ready wit, famed for her impromptu verses and stories.<br>
        The great family amusement was acting.</p>
